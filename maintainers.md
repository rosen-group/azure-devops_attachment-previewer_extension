## Release Creation

For official releases a tag should be created, the pattern is `vX.X.X`, this
automatically triggers a release workflow.

For any pre-releases the release workflow can be triggered manually, the pattern
for the tag version is `vX.X.X-suffix`, these releases are automatically labeled
as pre-releases and should not be used for official releases!
